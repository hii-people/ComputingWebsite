		<h2> Secondary Storage </h2>
		<h3> Optical Storage </h3>
		<p>Optical storage is the storage of data on an optically readable medium. Data is recorded by making marks in a pattern that can be read back with the aid of light, usually a beam of laser light precisely focused on a spinning optical disc.</p>
		<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Pros</th>
    <th>Cons</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One of the biggest advantages of optical storage over other storage media is durability. Optical discs are not vulnerable to data loss due to power failure like volatile memory, and they're not as subject to wear as non-volatile memory (NVM) such as HDDs and flash SSDs.</td>
    <td>Can lose data when scratched.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The manufacturing costs are significantly lower in Optical disks since only aluminium foils and plastics are involved in the production. Hence, the users can be benefited from the cost of purchasing optical disks in bulk. And many computers include Optical Disk Drive from its respective manufacturer so that the users don't need to purchase them separate.</td>
    <td>When the Optical disks are used for backup purposes, it should be kept safe from the hands of thieves. Due to its size, the optical disks are more prone to loss and theft.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The process of backup is made much easier using Optical disks. Whatever the data that needs to be burnt should be placed inside the drive icon. And then with just clicking on '' Burn Disk '' the users can backup the data.</td>
    <td>Optical disks cost more per GB/TB than any other forms of storage drives. And it too have very little storage capacity compared to them. Unless it is a Blu-ray disk, the maximum storage the Optical disks can offer is 4.7GB.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


		<h3> Magnetic Storage</h3>
		<p>Magnetic storage is the storage of data on a magnetically charged medium. Data is recored by changing the polarity of the material in the medium and can be read back with a moveable drive head.</p>
				
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Pros</th>
    <th>Cons</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Probably the cheapest form of storage per megabyte of storage</td>
    <td>Serial access so can be quite slow to access data</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can store large amounts of data - up to 1 Terabyte per tape cartridge</td>
    <td>Need a special piece of equipment to record and read the data on the tape</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can be set up to do the back up overnight or over the weekend</td>
    <td>The data may be corrupted if the tape is placed near a strong magnetic field e.g. a large speaker or magnet</td>
  </tr>
</table>
		<h3>Solid State Storage</h3>
		<p>Solid-state storage (SSS) is a type of non-volatile computer storage that stores and retrieves digital information using only electronic circuits, without any involvement of moving mechanical parts. Solid-state storage devices typically store data using electrically-programmable non-volatile flash memory, however some devices use battery-backed volatile random-access memory (RAM). Having no moving mechanical parts, solid-state storage is much faster than traditional electromechanical storage; as a downside, solid-state storage is significantly more expensive and suffers from the write amplification phenomenon.</p>
	
	<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Pros</th>
    <th>Cons</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SSDs read and write faster than HDDs. A typical SSD can read at about 550 megabytes per second (MBps) and write at 520 MBps in normal conditions. On the other hand, an HDD can only read and write at 125MBps—more than four times slower than the SSD. Just looking at the numbers, you can see their performance is vastly different.</td>
    <td>More expensive than DVDs. Requires a Blu-ray player. Can lose data when scratched.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SSDs have no mechanization and, as a result, are far less likely to fail compared to optical storage disks.</td>
    <td>SSDs cost far more than their HDD counterparts. Usually, for comparable storage capacity, you’ll pay double for an SSD than for an HDD.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Since SSDs have no moving parts, they make no sound.</td>
    <td>Every SSD has a specific amount of times it can be read or written. This is called terabytes written (TBW). When you buy an SSD, the device comes with a predetermined “time of death,” which is impacted by how frequently you use the drive.</td>
  </tr>
